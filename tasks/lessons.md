- Never present an optimistic realtime command as server-confirmed. Pre-match UI must expose authoritative connection, player presence, and readiness, and the client must retain a hero choice made before the room join completes.
- Multiplayer smoke assertions must compare against the player's assigned team, not assume concurrent clients always join in the same order.
